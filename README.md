> **1,599 memories** · **33 MCP tools** · **Graph + Vector hybrid retrieval** · **sub-200ms search** · **1,165 tests**

An open-source MCP server that gives any LLM long-term memory using a knowledge graph + vector search hybrid. Store entities, observations, and relationships — then recall them semantically across sessions. Works with any MCP client: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, or any LLM that speaks [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Unlike flat chat history or simple RAG, Dragon Brain understands *relationships* between memories — not just similarity. An autonomous agent ("The Librarian") periodically clusters and synthesizes memories into higher-order concepts.

![Dragon Brain Dashboard — 1,599 nodes, 3,120 relationships, graph visualization and health metrics](docs/dashboard.png)

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
> **Detailed setup:** See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for comprehensive instructions including prerequisites, platform-specific notes, and troubleshooting.

### 1. Start the Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This spins up 4 containers:
- **FalkorDB** (knowledge graph) — port 6379
- **Qdrant** (vector search) — port 6333
- **Embedding API** (BGE-M3, CPU default) — port 8001
- **Dashboard** (Streamlit) — port 8501

> **GPU users:** `docker compose --profile gpu up -d` for NVIDIA CUDA acceleration.

Verify everything is healthy:
```bash
docker ps --filter "name=claude-memory"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: Install via pip</b></summary>

```bash
pip install dragon-brain
```

> **Note:** Dragon Brain requires FalkorDB and Qdrant running as Docker services.
> The pip package installs the MCP server — run `docker compose up -d` first for the infrastructure.
> The embedding model (~1GB) is served via Docker, not downloaded locally.

</details>

### 2. Connect Your AI Agent

**Claude Code (recommended):**
```bash
claude mcp add dragon-brain -- python -m claude_memory.server
```

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop / Other MCP Clients</b></summary>

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dragon-brain": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "claude_memory.server"],
      "env": {
        "FALKORDB_HOST": "localhost",
        "FALKORDB_PORT": "6379",
        "QDRANT_HOST": "localhost",
        "QDRANT_PORT": "6333",
        "EMBEDDING_API_URL": "http://localhost:8001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See `mcp_config.example.json` for a full template. This server works with any MCP-compatible client via stdio transport.

</details>

### 3. Start Remembering

```
You: "Remember that I'm building Atlas in Rust and I prefer functional patterns."
AI:  [creates entity "Atlas", adds observations about Rust and functional patterns]

You (next session): "What do you know about my projects?"
AI:  "You're building Atlas in Rust with a functional approach..." [recalled from graph]
```

## What It Does

| Capability | How It Works |
|------------|-------------|
| **Store memories** | Creates entities (people, projects, concepts) with typed observations |
| **Semantic search** | Finds memories by meaning, not just keywords — "that thing about distributed systems" works |
| **Graph traversal** | Follows relationships between memories — "what's connected to Project X?" |
| **Time travel** | Queries your memory graph at any point in time — "what did I know last Tuesday?" |
| **Auto-clustering** | Background agent discovers patterns and creates concept summaries |
| **Relationship discovery** | Semantic Radar finds missing connections by comparing vector similarity against graph distance |
| **Session tracking** | Remembers conversation context and breakthroughs |

## Use Cases

- **AI Power Users** — Track preferences, project context, and breakthroughs across
  hundreds of conversations with any MCP-compatible AI. Never re-explain your setup.
- **Software Development** — Remember architecture decisions, debugging sessions, and
  codebase patterns. Your AI pair programmer actually learns your codebase over time.
- **Research & Knowledge Management** — Build a living knowledge graph of papers,
  concepts, and their connections. Semantic search finds "that thing about distributed
  consensus" even if you never used those exact words.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Share persistent memory across multiple AI agents
  coordinating on complex workflows. One agent's discoveries are instantly available
  to all others via the shared graph.
- **Personal Knowledge Base** — A second brain that grows richer over time. The
  Librarian autonomously discovers patterns and clusters related memories into
  higher-order concepts.
- **Cross-Model Workflows** — Start a conversation in Claude, continue in Gemini CLI,
  review in Cursor. The memory persists across all MCP-compatible clients.

- **Graph Layer**: FalkorDB stores entities, relationships, and observations as a Cypher-queryable knowledge graph
- **Vector Layer**: Qdrant stores 1024d embeddings for semantic similarity search
- **Hybrid Search**: Queries hit both layers, merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with spreading activation enrichment
- **Semantic Radar**: Discovers missing relationships by comparing vector similarity against graph distance
- **The Librarian**: Autonomous agent that clusters memories and synthesizes higher-order concepts

## MCP Tools (Top 10)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `create_entity` | Store a new person, project, concept, or any typed node |
| `add_observation` | Attach a fact or note to an existing entity |
| `search_memory` | Semantic + graph hybrid search across all memories |
| `get_hologram` | Get an entity with its full connected context (neighbors, observations, relationships) |
| `create_relationship` | Link two entities with a typed, weighted edge |
| `get_neighbors` | Explore what's directly connected to an entity |
| `point_in_time_query` | Query the graph as it existed at a specific timestamp |
| `record_breakthrough` | Mark a significant learning moment for future reference |
| `semantic_radar` | Discover missing relationships via vector-graph gap analysis |
| `graph_health` | Get stats on your memory graph — node counts, edge density, orphans |

All 33 tools are documented in [docs/MCP_TOOL_REFERENCE.md](docs/MCP_TOOL_REFERENCE.md).

## Quality

This isn't a weekend hack. It's tested like production software:

- **1,165 unit tests** across 77 files, 0 failures, 0 skipped
- **Mutation testing** — 2,270 mutants, 1,184 killed across 27 source files (3-evil/1-sad/1-happy per function)
- **Property-based testing** — 38 Hypothesis properties
- **Fuzz testing** — 30K+ inputs, 0 crashes
- **Static analysis** — mypy strict mode (0 errors), ruff (0 errors)
- **Security audit** — Cypher injection audit, credential scanning
- **Dead code detection** — Vulture (0 findings)
- **Dragon Brain Gauntlet** — 20-round automated quality audit, **A- (95/100)**

## Why I Built This

Claude is brilliant but forgets everything between conversations. Every new chat starts from scratch — no context, no continuity, no accumulated understanding. I wanted Claude to *remember* me: my projects, preferences, breakthroughs, and the connections between them. Not a flat chat history dump, but a living knowledge graph that grows richer over time.

## Local Development

Requires **Python 3.12+**.

```bash
# Install
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
tox -e pulse

# Run server locally
python -m claude_memory.server

# Run dashboard
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add dragon-brain -- python -m claude_memory.server
```

For environment variables, create a `.env` file or export them:

```bash
export FALKORDB_HOST=localhost
export FALKORDB_PORT=6379
export QDRANT_HOST=localhost
export EMBEDDING_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Port 6379 or 6333 already in use</b></summary>

Another service (Redis, another FalkorDB/Qdrant instance) is using the port.
Either stop the conflicting service or change the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "6380:6379"  # Map to a different host port
```

Then update your environment variables to match.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GPU not detected / falling back to CPU</b></summary>

Ensure you're using the GPU profile: `docker compose --profile gpu up -d`

Requirements:
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed
- Docker configured for GPU access

CPU mode works fine for most workloads — GPU mainly speeds up bulk embedding operations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>MCP connection timeout in Claude Desktop</b></summary>

1. Verify all 4 containers are running: `docker ps --filter "name=claude-memory"`
2. Check the embedding API is healthy: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
3. Ensure your `claude_desktop_config.json` paths are correct (use forward slashes)
4. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>"No module named claude_memory" error</b></summary>

Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`

Or set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to the `src/` directory:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Dragon-Brain/src
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Memories not persisting between sessions</b></summary>

Docker volumes store persistent data. If you used `docker-compose down -v`, the
volumes were deleted. Use `docker-compose down` (without `-v`) to preserve data.

To verify data persistence:
```bash
docker exec claude-memory-mcp-graphdb-1 redis-cli GRAPH.QUERY claude_memory \
  "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)"
```
